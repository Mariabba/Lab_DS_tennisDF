# Currencies :																		
# ============																		
#																		
# A number of territories are not included in ISO 4217, because their currencies are not per se an independent currency, 																		
# but a variant of another currency. These currencies are:																		
#																		
# 1. FO : Faroese krona (1:1 pegged to the Danish krone)																		
# 2. GG : Guernsey pound (1:1 pegged to the pound sterling)																		
# 3. JE : Jersey pound (1:1 pegged to the pound sterling)																		
# 4. IM : Isle of Man pound (1:1 pegged to the pound sterling)																		
# 5. TV : Tuvaluan dollar (1:1 pegged to the Australian dollar).																		
# 6. CK : Cook Islands dollar (1:1 pegged to the New Zealand dollar).																		
#																		
# The following non-ISO codes are, however, sometimes used: GGP for the Guernsey pound, 																		
# JEP for the Jersey pound and IMP for the Isle of Man pound (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
